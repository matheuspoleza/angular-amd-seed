## What is angularAMD?
AngularAMD is an utility that facilitates the use of RequireJS in AngularJS applications supporting on-demand loading of 3rd party modules such as angular-ui.
Check it out: [AngularAMD repository](https://github.com/marcoslin/angularAMD)

## Why write modular angular app?
- Provides a clear proposal for how to approach defining flexible modules.
- Significantly cleaner than the present global namespace and script tag solutions many of us rely on. There's a clean way to declare stand-alone modules and dependencies they may have.
- Module definitions are encapsulated, helping us to avoid pollution of the global namespace.
- It's possible to lazy load scripts if this is needed.
